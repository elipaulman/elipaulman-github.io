    "short": "I'm a Software Quality Engineer at Apple, where I work on the carrier services that power iPhone activation. I graduated from Ohio State (CSE, December 2025) and love shipping production systems — I've built them at Amazon and London Computer Systems, focusing on automation and scalable architecture.",
    "detailed": "At Apple, I test and automate carrier onboarding workflows for iPhone. At Amazon, I automated catalog systems managing 13,000+ items with 60% efficiency gains. At LCS, I built REST APIs serving 100,000+ users. I'm passionate about AI/ML — I've developed AI-powered apps with LangChain, led 20+ engineers as ESW President, and won multiple J.P. Morgan hackathons."
